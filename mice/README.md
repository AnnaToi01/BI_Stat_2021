# Winter Project - Statistics&R

Here's a winter project about expression of proteins in a mice model simulating Down's syndrome. Data comes from Higuera C, Gardiner KJ, Cios KJ (2015) Self-Organizing Feature Maps Identify Proteins Critical to Learning in a Mouse Model of Down Syndrome. PLoS ONE 10(6): e0129126. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0129126) journal.pone.0129126. The data used in this project is found in `data` folder. The code and the generated HTML document in the folder `code`. The description for the requirements in the project is in the file [`exercise_description.pdf`](https://github.com/AnnaToi01/BI_Stat_2021/blob/mice/mice/exercise_description.pdf).
