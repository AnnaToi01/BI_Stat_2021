Here's PCA analysis of the supercondivity data. One of the files, `PCA.ipynb` just plainly took all the variables.  In `PCA_EDA.ipynb` all of the variables were filtered of, that only contained zeros and skewed our model. In `PCA_tSNE_UMAP.ipynb` sc-RNA seq data is analyzed using PCA and visualized using t-SNE as well as UMAP.
